# OOProgramming

## Procedural Programming:
   In procedural programming (programming paradigm/style of programming), the program is divided into smaller reusable procedures or functions, which are called sequentially to perform tasks. 
   
   The focus is on how to accomplish a task by specifying a series of steps or procedures. Procedural programming focuses on the step-by-step instructions to solve a problem
   
   Procedural programming typically uses loops and conditional statements.(and also functions but not the complex like recursion)
   
   C, Pascal, and Fortran are examples of procedural programming languages.
   
## Functional Programming:
   Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which the program is built around the concept of functions.
   
   A functional language allows you to write a mathematical function, i.e. a function that takes n arguments and returns a value. If the program is executed, this function is logically evaluated as needed.
   
   Functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang.
   
## Key Differences:

1. Procedural programming focuses on the step-by-step instructions to solve a problem, while functional programming focuses on composing functions and applying them to data.
2. In procedural programming, variables can be mutable, allowing changes throughout the program, whereas functional programming emphasizes immutability.
3. Procedural programming uses statements to modify state, while functional programming avoids changing state and instead uses expressions to compute values.
4. Functional programming often utilizes higher-order functions and recursion, while procedural programming typically uses loops and conditional statements.

Python and JavaScript, support both procedural and functional programming styles

# Top-Down Approach and Bottom-Up Approach

In the top-down approach, the entire problem is further divided into smaller, more manageable units until the problem is broken down into its most granular parts. Each component is then solved or implemented separately, and the solutions are integrated to form the complete solution.
